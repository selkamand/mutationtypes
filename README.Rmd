Say you want to describe the impact of a mutation. There exists several dictionaries you could use, including

1) [Sequence Ontology](http://www.sequenceontology.org/). These terms are what VEP uses

2) [MAF Variant Classification](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Encyclopedia/pages/Mutation_Annotation_Format_TCGAv2/)

3) [PAVE](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/hmftools/blob/master/pave/README.md) Consequences that the PAVE annotator supports (mostly a subset of SO terms but with a couple of additions to indicate when a non-obvious consequence can be found thanks to phasing)

**mutationtypes** makes it easy to check whether your vector of mutation types aligns to one of these dictionaries. 
It also simplifies translation from one dictionary to another.


## Installation

Install from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("mutationtypes")
```


Alternatively, you can install the development version of mutationtypes like so:

``` r
# install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github('selkamand/mutationtypes')
```

## Usage

```{r usage}
library(mutationtypes)

# Check which mutation impact dictionary you're vector is closest too
mutation_types_identify(
  c(
    "INTRAGENIC", 
    "INTRAGENIC", 
    "intergenic_region", 
    "stop_lost", 
    "missense_variant", 
    "missense_variant"
  )
)

# Convert sequence ontology mutation classes to MAF terms
mutation_types_convert_so_to_maf(
  so_mutation_types = c(
    "INTRAGENIC", 
    "INTRAGENIC", 
    "intergenic_region", 
    "stop_lost", 
    "missense_variant", 
    "missense_variant"
  )
)

# Convert PAVE mutation classes to MAF terms
mutation_types_convert_pave_to_maf(
  pave_mutation_types = c('upstream_gene_variant', 'phased_inframe_insertion', 'phased_missense')
)

# Get list of valid MAF terms
mutation_types_maf()

# Get list of valid SO terms
mutation_types_so()

# Get list of valid PAVE terms
mutation_types_pave()

# Get Palettes for MAF/SO/PAVE terms
mutation_types_maf_palette()
```
