Say you want to describe the impact of a mutation. There exists several dictionaries you could use, including

1) [Sequence Ontology](http://www.sequenceontology.org/). These terms are what VEP uses

2) [MAF Variant Classification](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Encyclopedia/pages/Mutation_Annotation_Format_TCGAv2/)


**mutationtypes** makes it easy to check whether your vector of mutation types aligns to one of these dictionaries. 
It also simplifies translation from one dictionary to another.


## Installation

You can install the development version of mutationtypes like so:

``` r
# install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github('selkamand/mutation_types.R')
```

## Usage

```{r usage}
library(mutationtypes)

# Check which mutation impact dictionary you're vector is closest too
mutation_types_identify(
  c(
    "INTRAGENIC", 
    "INTRAGENIC", 
    "intergenic_region", 
    "stop_lost", 
    "missense_variant", 
    "missense_variant"
  )
)

# Convert sequence ontology mutation classes to MAF terms
mutation_types_convert_so_to_maf(
  so_mutation_types = c(
    "INTRAGENIC", 
    "INTRAGENIC", 
    "intergenic_region", 
    "stop_lost", 
    "missense_variant", 
    "missense_variant"
  )
)

# Get list of valid MAF/SO terms
mutation_types_maf()

# Get Palettes for MAF/SO terms
mutation_types_maf_palette()
```
