Description: Check concordance of a vector of mutation impacts with standard dictionaries such as Sequence Ontology (SO) <http://www.sequenceontology.org/>, Mutation Annotation Format (MAF) <https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Encyclopedia/pages/Mutation_Annotation_Format_TCGAv2/> or Prediction and Annotation of Variant Effects (PAVE) <https://github.com/hartwigmedical/hmftools/tree/master/pave>. 
  It enables conversion between SO/PAVE and MAF terms and selection of the most severe consequence where multiple ampersand (&) delimited impacts are given.
